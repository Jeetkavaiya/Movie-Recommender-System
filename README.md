## Introduction

The Movie Recommender System aims to provide users with personalized movie recommendations. It leverages various recommendation algorithms, including content-based filtering and collaborative filtering, to suggest movies that users are likely to enjoy.

## Dataset

The TMDB dataset used in this project contains information about movies, including metadata such as genres, cast, crew, and keywords. The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Jeetkavaiya/Movie-Recommender-System.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd movie-recommender-system
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For MacOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the Movie Recommender System:

1. Ensure you have the TMDB dataset downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory.

2. Run the Jupyter notebook to explore and execute the recommendation system:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Open the `Movie-Recommender-System.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions to generate movie recommendations.

## Model Description

The Movie Recommender System uses the following approaches to recommend movies:

1. **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to those the user has liked in the past based on movie features like genres, keywords, and cast.

2. **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes user behavior (e.g., ratings) to find similarities between users and suggest movies liked by similar users.

3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering methods to improve recommendation accuracy.
